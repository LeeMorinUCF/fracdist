# fracdist with C++

Numerical Distribution Functions of Fractional Unit Root and Cointegration Tests

I briefly experimented with the idea of extending R to C++ to call some Functions
to calculate p-values and critical values for the rank tests in the
[FCVAR](https://github.com/LeeMorinUCF/FCVAR).

Once I took a closer look inside, I saw that it was easier to rewrite a version in R
and save the users one more installation.

For those interested in a C++ version of this software, see the C++
[fracdist](https://github.com/jagerman/fracdist/) package.
