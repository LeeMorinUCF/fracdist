# fracdist with Fortran

Numerical Distribution Functions of Fractional Unit Root and Cointegration Tests

These files were used to experiment with the original ```fracdist.f```
program on which this R packages is based.
The Fortran program is freely available on the website of the
Journal of Applied Econometrics, in the archive to accompany the article by
James G. MacKinnon and Morten Ã˜rregaard Nielsen,
"Numerical Distribution Functions of Fractional Unit Root
and Cointegration Tests," *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, Vol. 29, No. 1,
2014, pp.161-171.  

The folder ```R_test_cases``` contains a program and files to, well, test the
R code used in the R package ```fracdist```.


For those of you interested in running the software in Fortran,
the program and data associated with the paper are available here:
