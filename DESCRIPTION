Description: Numerical asymptotic distribution functions of likelihood ratio tests for 
    fractional unit roots and cointegration rank. Because these distributions depend 
    on a real-valued parameter b which must be estimated, simple tabulation is not 
    feasible. Instead, response surface regressions are used to obtain the numerical 
    distribution functions and combined by model averaging. As a function of the 
    dimension of the problem, q, and a value of the fractional integration order b, 
    this provides either a set of critical values or the asymptotic P-value for any 
    value of the likelihood ratio statistic.
