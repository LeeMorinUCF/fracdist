Description: Numerical asymptotic distribution functions of likelihood ratio tests for fractional 
    unit roots and co-integration rank. For these distributions, the included functions calculate 
    critical values and P-values used in unit root tests, co-integration tests, and rank tests in the 
    Fractionally Co-integrated Vector Autoregression (F.C.V.A.R.) model.
