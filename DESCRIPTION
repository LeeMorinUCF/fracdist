Description: Numerical asymptotic distribution functions of likelihood ratio statistics for fractional 
    unit root tests and tests of cointegration rank. For these distributions, the included functions calculate 
    critical values and P-values used in unit root tests, cointegration tests, and rank tests in the 
    Fractionally Cointegrated Vector Autoregression (FCVAR) model.
