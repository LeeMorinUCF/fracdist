Description: Numerical asymptotic distribution functions of likelihood ratio tests for fractional 
    unit roots and cointegration rank. From these distributions, the included functions calculate 
    critial values and p-values for unit root and cointegration tests and for rank tests in the 
    Fractionally Cointegrated Vector Autoregression (FCVAR) model.
