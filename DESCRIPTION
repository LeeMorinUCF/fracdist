Description: Numerical asymptotic distribution functions of likelihood ratio tests for fractional 
    unit roots and cointegration rank. For these distributions, the included functions calculate 
    critial values and P-values used in unit root tests, cointegration tests, and rank tests in the 
    Fractionally Cointegrated Vector Autoregression (FCVAR) model.
